2. Assistance includes:
   - Rental subsidies
   - Housing vouchers
   - Below-market public housing units
   - First-time homebuyer grants
3. This Act does not affect emergency shelter provisions.

---

## Article 2 — Area Median Income (AMI) Standard

1. Eligibility shall be assessed by reference to **Area Median Income (AMI)** as calculated annually by the Ministry of Social Development and Housing.
2. AMI values shall be published for each administrative region by 31 December of the preceding year.
3. Where regional data is unavailable, the national median income shall apply.
4. AMI calculations shall be based on gross household income including all sources.

---

## Article 3 — Base Income Ceiling

1. To qualify for housing assistance, household income must not exceed **60% of the applicable AMI**.
2. This threshold is calculated as: Income Ceiling = AMI × 0.60
3. Households with income exceeding this ceiling are categorically ineligible.

---

## Article 4 — Household Size Adjustment

1. For households with **more than four (4) members**, the income ceiling shall be increased by **10%**.
2. The adjusted threshold is calculated as: 
   - Adjusted Ceiling = (AMI × 0.60) × 1.10
   - Equivalently: Adjusted Ceiling = AMI × 0.66
3. This adjustment recognizes the increased financial burden of larger households.
4. Household members include all persons residing in the dwelling, regardless of relationship.

   - Rental assistance from other programs
   - Mortgage interest subsidies
   - Property tax relief specifically tied to housing need
   - Employer-provided housing benefits exceeding market rates
3. General welfare benefits and child allowances do not constitute housing subsidies for this purpose.

## Article 6 — Eligibility Determination Process

Applications shall be evaluated using this three-stage test:

**Stage 1 - Income Test:**
- Household size ≤ 4: Income must be ≤ (AMI × 0.60)
- Household size > 4: Income must be ≤ (AMI × 0.66)

**Stage 2 - Household Composition:**
- Verify actual number of household members
- Apply appropriate income ceiling

**Stage 3 - Subsidy Exclusivity:**
- Confirm absence of other housing subsidies

2. Households whose circumstances change during the benefit period must report changes within 30 days.
3. Failure to recertify results in automatic suspension of benefits.
