### PREAMBLE

The Parliament of the Republic of Lysmark, recognizing the necessity of predictable remedies for breach of commercial obligations and the importance of balancing creditor protection with debtor fairness, hereby enacts rules governing liquidated damages for delayed performance.

---

## Article 1 — Purpose and Scope

1. This Act regulates the calculation and enforcement of liquidated damages arising from delayed performance of commercial obligations.
2. It applies to all commercial contracts governed by Lysmark law where parties have agreed to time-sensitive performance obligations.
3. Consumer contracts remain subject to the Consumer Protection Act.

---

## Article 2 — Daily Accrual of Penalties

1. Where a contract specifies liquidated damages for delay, penalties shall accrue on a **daily basis** from the first day following the agreed deadline.
2. The daily rate shall be as stipulated in the contract or, absent agreement, at the statutory default rate established by the Ministry of Justice.
3. Accrual continues until performance is completed or the contract is terminated.

---

## Article 3 — Maximum Cap Limitation

1. No liquidated damages shall exceed the **contractual maximum cap** where such a cap has been agreed between parties.
2. Once the accumulated daily penalties reach the cap, no further penalty accrual shall occur, regardless of continued delay.
3. The cap limitation protects against disproportionate penalties while maintaining incentive for timely performance.

---

## Article 4 — Interest on Penalty Obligations

1. Once the penalty amount is determined (whether capped or uncapped), **statutory interest** shall accrue on that penalty amount.
2. Interest applies from the date the penalty becomes due and payable until actual payment.
3. The interest rate shall be as specified in the contract or, absent agreement, at the statutory commercial rate.

---

## Article 5 — Calculation Methodology

The total amount owed shall be calculated as follows:

1. **Step 1:** Determine days of delay from deadline to performance/termination date.
2. **Step 2:** Calculate base penalty = days × daily rate.
3. **Step 3:** Apply cap limitation if base penalty exceeds contractual maximum.
4. **Step 4:** Calculate interest on the final penalty amount (post-cap if applicable).
5. **Step 5:** Total obligation = capped/uncapped penalty + accrued interest.

---

## Article 6 — Enforcement and Collection

1. Creditors may enforce liquidated damages through standard debt collection procedures.
2. Courts shall not reduce agreed liquidated damages except where they constitute an unlawful penalty under Article 29 of the Constitution.
3. The Ministry of Justice shall maintain public guidance on reasonable penalty rates by industry sector.

---

## Article 7 — Reporting and Transparency

1. Commercial entities entering into contracts with liquidated damages clauses must ensure terms are clearly documented.
2. Penalty calculations must be provided to obligors in writing within 15 days of breach.
3. Disputes regarding calculation methodology may be submitted to commercial arbitration.

---

## Article 8 — Implementation

1. The Ministry of Justice is tasked with issuing regulations necessary for the practical enforcement of this Act.
2. This Act shall enter into force on **1 October 2025** and remain valid until amended or repealed by Parliament.
